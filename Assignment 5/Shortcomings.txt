The grammar that the compiler TinyC is based on is a restricted subset of the grammar of the language C. Hence not all the statements of C will be supported by the grammar. Some of them are:
	-> sizeof, comma, complex assignement operator are not supported.
	-> Declarations within "for" is nopt supported.
	-> switch case construct is not supported.
	-> Complex expressions are not supported.
	-> Rules not asked in the grammar list, if encountered results in segmentstion fault.

Another drawback of the language is that it will accwpt semantically wrong codes as well. The compiler does not implement any error handling and recovery steps.
