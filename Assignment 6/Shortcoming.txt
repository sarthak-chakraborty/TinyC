				SHORTCOMINGS
-------------------------------------------------------

	The grammar that the compiler TinyC supports is a restricted subset of the grammar of the language C. Hence not all the statements of C will be supported by the grammar. Some of them are:
-> sizeof, comma, complex assignement operator are not supported.
-> Declarations within "for" is nopt supported.
-> switch case construct is not supported.
-> Complex expressions are not supported.
-> Rules not asked in the grammar list, if encountered results in segmentstion fault.

	Array handling and pointer handling is not supported by the compiler. Also, recursive functions is not supported.
If programs using these above types of instructions are used, it will result to segmentation fault on an attempt to
run the program. However, loops are well supported and hence iteration can be performed using TinyC.
